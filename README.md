# Diktat-Enhancement
A mod that adds a bunch of new content to the Sindrian Diktat, ranging from ships and weapons to markets and interactions.

Ever felt the Sindrian Diktat was too weak as a faction? Ever wanted to see it actually do anything in Nexerelin games without flopping and dying as soon as another faction remembers it exists?

Well look no further! This mod considerably buffs up the Sindrian Diktat to somewhere between Tri-Tachyon and PL/Hegemony level of size and power, giving them a new system, new markets, lots of QOL things, secret things, fighters and lots more! Also adds some non-Diktat related content; which can be toggled in settings.json if they don't suit your tastes(only on new game gen however!).

And if you don’t want the Diktat to be overtuned or come out of their little searing hidey-hole DE now adds Lite Mode, a mode toggleable in settings.json that removes most extra-Askonia DE-added content!

And if you want the Diktat to stay in Askonia only DE now adds Fortress Mode, a mode toggleable in settings.json that replaces much DE content(when applicable) with Askonia-based substitutes!

Now compatible with PAGSM(mostly).

Partially save compatible - Won’t crash your game if loaded in the midst of a save, but many features(primarily markets) will not be applied to the existing savegame.

Also note that DE can and often will break vanilla lore about the Sindrian Diktat. Be warned.

NOTE: there is also a compressed file of all DE releases since 1.0.0 if you so wish to return to an earlier version. However, most(if not all) of these won't work on an existing save.
